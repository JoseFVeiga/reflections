Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I'd want to use a remote repository whenever i want to share my code: either publicly with everyone as an open source project, or privately if it's something proprietary i am working on with a group of people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because if my local repository suffered unwanted changes, i could possibly checkout a head commit from my local repository that wasn't the one expected.
